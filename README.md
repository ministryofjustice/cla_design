Design files for the Civil Legal Aid tool
==========

The current configuration of design files is according to the role of the end-user of the Civil Legal Aid tool(s). There are three roles:

* **The user** who is the member of the public and fills in the form themselves to determine whether or not they are eligible for Civil Legal Aid
* **The operator** in the call centre who answers the phone and determines the member of the public's problem and context and conducts the means test for the user
* **The Specialist Provider** who is a legal professional who is assigned the case by the operator and will handle the user's case
