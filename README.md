Design files for the Civil Legal Aid tool
==========

The current configuration of design files is according to the role of the end-user of the Civil Legal Aid tool(s). There are three roles:

* **The user** who is the member of the public and fills in the form themselves to determine whether or not they are eligible for Civil Legal Aid
* **The operator** in the call centre who answers the phone and determines the member of the public's problem and context and conducts the means test for the user
* **The Specialist Provider** who is a legal professional who is assigned the case by the operator and will handle the user's case

## Update (30 July 2014)
- General progress on design
- The file is setup in pages in Sketch
-- Styles for the whole case handling system
-- Icons (as symbols) that are used throughout
- Each flow has a page:
-- Operator receiving a case digitally or through call
-- The Operator adding contact details
-- Help
-- Alerts

## A note on branches (27 May 2014)

There are currently three branches to facilitate design for user testing.

* **Testing-A** - user facing form which has the category of law questioning after the means testing. Note: The Operator.sketch and Provider.sketch designs are largely unchanged as these branches are for user testing
* **Testing-B** - user facing form which has the means testing after the determination of category of law. Note: The Operator.sketch and Provider.sketch designs are largely unchanged as these branches are for user testing
* **Master** - Original User.sketch designs plus additions and design work on the Operator.sketch and Provider.sketch.
